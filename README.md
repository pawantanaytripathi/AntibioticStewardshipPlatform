# Antibiotic Stewardship Platform

A neural network based platform to predict which antibiotic salts might become less effective in the near future.

## Features
This project was part of the SIH(Smart India Hackathon) 2020 for Amazon's problem statement and was selected among top projects in internal hackathon as well. Following are its salient features - 
- Predict which antibiotic salts might go ineffective in near future.
- Store all the information of patient's for future treatment needs (Hospital Information System).
- Recording day-to-day usage of antibiotics in a hospital for neural-nets to be trained upon.
- Hence using the collected data to train itself while the database helps serve the need to maintain old records of their patients for the hospital.
